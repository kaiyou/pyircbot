PyIRCBot

PyIRCBot is released as a Python module and a couple of classes to be extended 
and build a full featured application. It aims at serving as an easy to use 
Python framework for people prototyping IRC robots. It makes extensive use of 
asynchronous development model and Reactor design pattern through the 
underlying Twisted framework; thus, it is quite efficient and has a really 
small memory footprint regarding its abilities.

The framework was initially developped as an independant project but was then 
linked to a specific robot project for a couple of months. Due to many people 
asking for the core library, the code was cleaned and is now published as a 
standalone library.

Dependencies

PyIRCBot is intended to run any UNIX-like operating system, including
GNU/Linux distributions; it has been tested and running on different computers
running both Fedora and Debian distributions, without any other software
package than those available on default repository. It mostly depends on the 
following software:

* Python>2.7, you might get a free Python interpretor from the Python project
  website:

* Twisted>11, included core, words and names, you might a free copy of the
  Python Twisted library from the Twisted project website:
